http://coderepos.org/share/wiki/Resh

== Installation

=== Archive Installation

	rake install

=== Gem Installation

	gem install resh


== Features/Problems

RubyGems install this to GEMHOME, so raw rdoc command is not able to find
'resh'. In like this case, use RUBYOPT to load rubygems

	RUBYOPT="-rubygems" rdoc --template resh foobar

Any other gem loaded context, above option is not required.

* Rake::RDocTask
* ~/.gemrc
